    "description": "Software Engineer <br> I am a passionate software engineer with 3 years of experience crafting scalable and performant web applications. Specializing in JavaScript, TypeScript, and PHP, I work across the stack using technologies like React, Next.js, NestJS, and Laravel to deliver clean, user-focused solutions. <br><br> With a strong foundation in microservices, I enjoy architecting systems that are modular, efficient, and easy to maintain. My development toolkit includes RabbitMQ, Redis, and PostgreSQL, and I consistently apply best practices such as SOLID principles and OOP in my code. <br><br> A continuous learner of DevOps and cloud-native development, I leverage AWS and DigitalOcean to automate deployments and optimize system performance. I've designed and maintained CI/CD pipelines using tools like GitHub Actions, Jenkins, and SonarQube to ensure rapid and reliable software delivery.<br><br> Throughout my career, I've led the development of complex platforms, including membership portals and e-commerce systems, serving thousands of users and driving measurable business outcomesâ€”such as a 90% cost reduction and 70% increase in renewals. <br><br> Let's connect to share ideas and explore how we can build secure, scalable, and user-centered software together!",
